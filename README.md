## superCarz is a Front End Project created with React.js, react-bootstrap, & react-router.

I set out to create this project in efforts to showcase my abilities with [sorting](src/Components/Functions/carSort.js).

The functionality of the implementation is very fluid, and the solution elegant.

Project Highlights:
- Furthering my React style.
- Incorporating more reusable components.
- Gaining a deeper understanding of React Router to aid in app navigation.

Lessons Learned:
- Plan layout and implementation of CSS.
- Repurpose custom CSS where possible.
- Utilize more bootstrap shortcuts/capabilities.
- Better incorporate  HTML elements with JSX (mostly using div's).
